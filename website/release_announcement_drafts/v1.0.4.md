This release of JBrowse Web includes a _great_ many small improvements and bug fixes, see the full changelog below.

Some particularly salient improvements include:

## Linear view sequence fetching

Users can now download regions of sequence by selecting a region in the linear genome view and clicking "get sequence". See the demonstration video below:

A long-requested feature, implemented in [#1588](https://github.com/GMOD/jbrowse-components/pull/1588) by [@teresam856](https://github.com/teresam856)!

## Enhanced navigation of paired end reads and BND/TRA breakends

Feature details of paired-end alignment reads and variants now contain links to open new views to help understand the regions or reads that they are related to.

Aligned reads with information on "supplementary" alignments, such as most paired-end reads, now contain special links in their feature details that open a new linear genome view showing the other read(s) in the group.

Similarly, feature details for `BND` and `TRA` breakpoints in variant tracks have links to open new breakpoint split views, allowing users to visualize both sides of the breakend or translocation.
